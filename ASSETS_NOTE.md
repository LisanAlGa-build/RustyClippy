# Clippy Assets Setup

The Clippy sprite sheet and animation map need to be obtained from the [clippy.js project](https://github.com/clippyjs/clippy.js).

## Quick Setup

Visit https://www.s3.clippy.js.org/ and download:
1. Clippy agent sprite: Place in `src/assets/agents/Clippy/agent.png`
2. Animation map: Already included at `src/assets/agents/Clippy/map.json`

Alternatively, you can extract these from the original clippy.js library if you have it installed.

## Current Status

The app structure is complete, but the Clippy sprite PNG needs to be manually added due to CDN/download issues during setup.

The animation map (map.json) is already in place.
